# jQuery Lite 

## Overview 

This project recreates most of the important functionality of the jQuery Library. jQuery is widely used for making AJAX requests, handling events, manipulating the DOM, and guranteeing it works across browsers.  

Most of this functionality is implemented using the native DOM API that is built right into every browser. 

## Goals 

+ Traverse and manipulate the DOM using vanilla JavaScript 
+ Be able to create a class to serve as a wrapper for DOM nodes / HTML elements 
+ Create Event Listeners using vanilla JavaScript
